## Overview

In this group assignment, you will collaborate in teams of **three students** to explore how different technologies can be applied to a real-world use case involving real-time data management and communication. You are expected to demonstrate an understanding of **REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets**, and provide a recommendation for the most suitable technology or combination of technologies for your chosen scenario.

> **IMPORTANT:** This is a **design and analysis** assignment — you are **not** required to write code. Your deliverable is a well-structured technical report and a video presentation.

---

## Use Case Options

As a group, choose **one real-world use case** from the following list:

| # | Use Case | Description |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Real-time Chat Application** | Customer support or social platform with live messaging |
| 2 | **Live Sports Update System** | Real-time scores, play-by-play updates, and standings |
| 3 | **Real-time Stock Market Monitoring App** | Live price feeds, portfolio tracking, and alerts |
| 4 | **Real-time IoT Monitoring System** | Sensor data dashboards, device management, and alerts |

---

## Requirements

Your submission must address the following four sections.

### Section 1: REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates

Explain how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.

---

### Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication

Describe how WebSockets could be used to handle real-time communication in your chosen system.

---

### Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification

Recommend which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system and justify your recommendation based on your analysis in Sections 1 and 2.

---

### Section 4: System Architecture Diagram

Create a diagram that illustrates the overall architecture of your system, showing how clients, APIs (REST and/or GraphQL), WebSockets, and backend services connect and interact. You may use any diagramming tool (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, Excalidraw, Mermaid) and include the diagram as an image in your report.

---

## Video Presentation

Each group must prepare **a short video presentation (5 to 10 minutes)** covering:

1. Your chosen use case and its requirements
2. Key REST vs. GraphQL considerations for your system
3. The role of WebSockets in your system
4. Your technology recommendation and reasoning
5. A walkthrough of your system architecture diagram

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Length** | 5 to 10 minutes |
| **Participation** | All group members must participate and present |
| **Upload** | YouTube (unlisted) |
| **Link** | Include the video link in your `README.md` file on GitHub |
| **Recording Tool** | [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (free, cross-platform) |

---

## Group Work Guidelines

- Each group consists of **3 students**
- Groups will be created in Brightspace and students will be **randomly assigned**
- Each group is responsible for dividing tasks equally and collaborating to complete the assignment
- Your submission must reflect the collective effort and understanding of all group members
- **Include a section** in your submission describing each member's contributions

---

## Submission Instructions

**Deliverables:** Technical report (Markdown `.md` file), video link (in `README.md`), and contribution statement (in the report).

**GitHub Repository:**
1. Create a **private** GitHub repository for your group
2. Add `ramymohamed10` as a collaborator (Settings → Collaborators → Add people)
3. Include your technical report as a Markdown file and the video link in `README.md`

> **Reference:** [Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

Submit your **GitHub Repository URL** on Brightspace by the due date.

> **Warning:** It is your responsibility to ensure the instructor is added as a collaborator before the deadline. Submissions without collaborator access at the time of marking will not be accepted.

## Academic Integrity

This assignment **permits** the use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to assist with research, brainstorming, or drafting, provided that:

1. **Transparency** — You disclose how AI was used and cite it properly in your report
2. **Original Thought** — The work primarily reflects your own understanding and effort
3. **Critical Evaluation** — You verify the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content

Directly submitting AI-generated work without modification, evaluation, or citation violates Algonquin College's Academic Integrity Policy AA48 and could result in a zero or further disciplinary action.

Collaboration **within** your group is expected. Collaboration **between** groups is not permitted.

---

## Late Submission Policy

Late submissions will **not** be accepted. Any changes made to your GitHub repository **after the deadline** will be **ignored**.
